    "<p>First, implement the function <code>sqsplit</code> which takes as input a (weighted) data set with labels and computes the best feature and cut-value of an optimal split based on minimum squared error. The third input is a weight vector which assigns a positive weight to each training sample. The loss you should minimize is the averaged weighted squared-loss:\n",

    "You are building a regression tree, and right now you need to choose a split for the given dataset $S=\\{(\\vec x_1,y_1),\\dots,(\\vec x_n,y_n)\\}$ (where we have continuous labels $y_i\\in{\\cal R}$).\n",
    "Suppose you split on some feature $j$ with value $c$ and partition the dataset in to two sets of indices, $L$--the set of indices on the left (i.e., $i \\in L \\Rightarrow [x_{i}]_{j} < c$)--and $R$--the set of indices on the right (i.e., $i \\in R \\Rightarrow [x_{i}]_{j} > c$). Suppose you assign every data point on the left the prediction $T_{L}$ and every data point on the right the prediction $T_{R}$. Finally, suppose that each data point $x_{i}$ has an associated weight $w_{i}$, and that the weights are normalized (i.e., $\\sum_{i} w_{i} = 1$). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> First, we show that setting $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ to the weighted average label over their respective sets (i.e., $T_{L} = \\frac{1}{W_{L}}\\sum_{i\\in L}w_{i}y_{i}$ and $T_{R} = \\frac{1}{W_{R}}\\sum_{i\\in R}w_{i}y_{i}$) minimizes the loss $\\cal L$, where $W_{L}=\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}$ and $W_{R}=\\sum_{i \\in R} w_{i}$ are the total weight of the left and right side respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> We take the derivative of the loss with respect to $T_{L}$ to obtain $$\\frac{d}{dT_{L}} {\\cal L}(S) = -2\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}(y_i - T_L)=-2\\sum_{i\\in L}w_iy_i + 2T_{L}\\sum_{i}w_{i}$$ Setting this equal to zero and solving, we get $$2T_{L}w_{L}=2\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}y_{i}$$ and therefore $$T_{L} = \\frac{1}{W_{L}}\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}y_{i}$$ A symmetric argument holds for $T_{R}$.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Now, imagine you are considering splitting on some feature $j$, and suppose you have already sorted the training points in the order of this feature value, so that $[x_{1}]_{j} < [x_{2}]_{j} < \\cdots < [x_{n}]_{j}$. You'd like to choose a split from among $c_{1} \\leq c_{2} \\leq \\cdots \\leq c_{n-1}$, where $c_{i}=\\frac{[x_{i}]_{j}+[x_{i+1}]_{j}}{2}$. One way to do this would be to, for each possible split $c_{k}$, decide whether each $x_{i}$ should be partitioned left or right, and compute $\\cal L$. At the end, take the split with the lowest loss. The number of data points $n$ and there are $O(n)$ splits to consider, and the proposed algorithm would require $O(n)$ per split to evaluate $\\cal L$, for a total of $O(n^2)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Now, suppose some split $c_{k}$ results in the data being partitioned in to $L^{(k)}$ and $R^{(k)}$. Suppose you are given the following quantities precomputed: $W_{L^{(k)}}$, $P_{L^{(k)}} = \\sum_{i \\in L} w_{i}y_{i}$, and $Q_{L^{(k)}} = \\sum_{i \\in L} w_{i}y_{i}^{2}$. Similarly, you are given $W_{R^{(k)}}$, $P_{R^{(k)}}$ and $Q_{R^{(k)}}$ Equipped with these precomputed quantities, we can compute $\\cal L$ in constant time:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Expand the left side of the loss to $$\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}y_{i}^{2} - 2\\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}y_{i}T_{L} + \\sum_{i \\in L}w_{i}T_{L}^{2}$$. The first term is exactly $Q_{L^{(k)}}$. The second term can be written as $-2P_{L^{(k)}}\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}}{W_{L^{(k)}}}=-2\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{L^{(k)}}}$. The last term can be written as $w_{L^{(k)}}\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}=\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{L^{(k)}}}$. The second term plus the third term is therefore simply $-\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{L^{(k)}}}$. Therefore the whole expression can be evaluated as: $$Q_{L^{(k)}}-\\frac{P_{L^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{L^{(k)}}}$$ Similarly, the right term is: $$Q_{R^{(k)}}-\\frac{P_{R^{(k)}}^{2}}{w_{R^{(k)}}}$$</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> <b> Efficent Update Rule: </b> If all feature values are distinct, only one data point moves from $R$ to $L$ when moving from split $k$ to split $k+1$. Therefore, we simply update the values accordingly. For example, we subtract $w_{k}$ from $W_{R^{(k)}}$ and add it to $W_{L^{(k)}}$. We subtract $w_{k}y_{k}$ from $P_{R^{(k)}}$ and add it to $P_{L^{(k)}}$. We subtract $w_{k}y_{k}^{2}$ from $Q_{R^{(k)}}$ and add it to $Q_{L^{(k)}}$. Crucially, all of these updates take only constant time. </p>"
